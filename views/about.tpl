        there are no logs stored in regard to IP address. the IP addresses are stored in temporary memory and are used to assign colors for each unique user.
        one can distinguish (to an extent (colors are recycled after so many unique users)) whether or not a message came from the same person, but in no way can tell who sent the message.
