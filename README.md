A Web-Controlled Speech Robot written with the Raspberry Pi in mind


This project is a learning experience for me. I've got a Raspberry Pi hooked up to a set of speakers in my living room. Using this website people can communicate through the web interface to send messages to me and my roommates.

The web interface uses bottle.py to handle routing and requests. It's been great working with bottle.py, very simple.
